The example was tested with Glassfish 3.0.1. Before deploying the application, database resources must be setup correctly.

1) Create a connection pool with the following properties:
Pool name: mygourmet-derby-pool
Resource type: javax.sql.DataSource
Datasource classname: org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDataSource
Additional Property: DatabaseName=memory:mygourmet;create=true

2) Create a JDBC resource
JNDI name: jdbc/mygourmet
Pool name: mygourmet-derby-pool
