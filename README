The example was tested with Glassfish 3.0.1. Unfortunately, the bundled version of Mojarra does not
work correctly. So you have to upgrade JSF manually (worked with version 2.1.3). For this, go to
folder /glassfish/modules in your Glassfish installation and replace jsf-api.jar and jsf-impl.jar
with newer versions - that's it. Glassfish 3.1.1 did not work at all (loads of exceptions).

Before deploying the application, database resources must be setup correctly.

1) Create a connection pool with the following properties:
Pool name: mygourmet-derby-pool
Resource type: javax.sql.DataSource
Datasource classname: org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDataSource
Additional Property: DatabaseName=memory:mygourmet;create=true

2) Create a JDBC resource
JNDI name: jdbc/mygourmet
Pool name: mygourmet-derby-pool
